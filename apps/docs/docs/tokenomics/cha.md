# CHA – Supply Protection & Wrapping

## Supply throttle

* **Max mint / burn:** 1 CHA every **1 440 Bitcoin blocks** (~1 week)
* **Annual change ceiling:** ≈ 52 CHA (&lt;0.05 % of supply)
* **Multisig:** 3-of-4 (Rozar, Kraqen, MooningShark, Vinzo) must approve any parameter change.
* **Upgrade plan:** raise the cooldown to 100 000 blocks (~1.9 years) per token.

Inflating total supply by just **1 %** would take millennia.

## Wrapping DMG ⇄ CHA

1. Lock 1 DMG → receive 1 CHA  
2. Burn 1 CHA → unlock 1 DMG  
3. Each action restarts the cooldown timer.  
4. Initially gated by the soul-bound **Red Pill NFT** issued to recovery supporters.

The throttle guarantees an orderly, first-come-first-served queue and removes classic bank-run risk.

## Market context

Only **132 k CHA** exist (market-cap ≈ $48 k). Comparable Stacks tokens:  
Velar ≈ $8.2 M • ALEX ≈ $30 M.

The protocol treasury is secured by the same **3-of-4 multisig** (`SM203CS4ESKFNCZMRBYA2C0TNW0E40B7JWNQB7P39`) and currently holds **≈ 25 000 CHA** (~20 % of supply). These reserves are earmarked for future listing fees and liquidity provisioning.

Given similar DeFi utility but extreme supply discipline, CHA appears materially undervalued.
