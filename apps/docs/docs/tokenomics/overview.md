# Charisma Tokenomics Overview

Charisma's economy revolves around two primary fungible tokens and a suite of reward / reputation assets. This overview lists the cast and explains **why two tokens exist**.

## Primary Tokens

| Token | Symbol | Current Supply | Focus |
|-------|--------|----------------|-------|
| Charisma Governance | **DMG** | 8 829 848.435 496 | GameFi, on-chain activity |
| Charisma Token | **CHA** | 132 430.657 471 | DeFi, strategic liquidity |

### Why two tokens?

DMG is the original governance & GameFi asset.

CHA is a tightly-controlled DeFi token introduced to guarantee robust supply security and stronger on-chain safeguards. DMG can be **wrapped 1 : 1** into CHA under a strict rate-limit.

See the dedicated pages for deeper dives into CHA's supply throttle, the Rulebook security layer and ENERGY reward engines.
