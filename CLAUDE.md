ALWAYS DO THE SIMPLEST AND MOST ELEGANT SOLUTION POSSIBLE

UTILIZE EXISTING TYPES FROM NPM DEPENDENCIES, DO NOT MAKE CUSTOM ONES WHENEVER POSSIBLE

UNDERSTAND THE INTERFACES AND FEATURES OF ALL DEPENDENCIES AND THE PROJECT YOUR WORKING IN

IF YOUR NOT SURE, ASK ME.

USE PNPM AND ONLY INSTALL DEPS FOR THE MONOREPO APP/PACKAGE

AVOID USING useMemo and useCallback! IF YOU FIND YOURSELF USING THEM, YOU SHOULD IMMEDIATLY CONSIDER STATE MANAGEMENT ISSUES

CREATE CONTEXTS AND PROVIDERS ONCE A FILE IS LARGER THAN 1000 LINES. MOVE ALL COMPONENTS INTO A NEW DIR AND BREAK OUT INTO NEW FILES

ASSUME I AM ALWAYS RUNNING THE DEV SERVER. DO NOT BUILD THE APP CODE UNLESS I ASK YOU TO

NEVER USE MOCK DATA, FALLBACKS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. THROW A DESCRIPTIVE ERROR AND HAVE CONSUMERS HANDLE IT.
